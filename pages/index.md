Hey! I'm Zhaichanghao, a front-end development engineer and student.

Looking for an internship<br>

Dreaming up cool ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. I am enthusiastic about finding new things and never get tired of it. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects).

I share my life, write [blog posts](/posts) and code in my website.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography, traveling and play online games. I post [photos on this page](/photos). I also love anime, movies and books.
